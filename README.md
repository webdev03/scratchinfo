# scratchinfo

An epic scratch stats website powered by SvelteKit and Vercel.

## Developing

Install the node dependencies through whatever node package manager you like (npm, pnpm, and yarn, or another one if you want to).
Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`.

# ScratchLight

This repository also includes the code for the ScratchLight authentication system, which Scratchinfo uses.

To use ScratchLight, just send your user to `/scratchlight/authpage?redirect=` with the `redirect` URL parameter being the Base64 encoded version of the page you want to direct your user to after they have authenticated, **excluding** the protocol and `://` which is assumed to be `https://`.

You also will need to add the `username` URL parameter with the value being the username of the user you would like to authenticate.

Then the user will be returned to your site with a `verifyCode` URL parameter.

Then once your user has returned to your site, `POST` to `/scratchlight/verify` with a request like this:

```json
{
  "code": "Your verifyCode URL parameter"
}
```

ScratchLight will either return two responses: one for success, and one for failure. I recommend verifying the authentication status on the server, so that you can issue a JWT/session cookie.

Success:

```json
{
  "isError": false,
  "username": "god286"
}
```

Failure:

```json
{
  "isError": true
}
```

**After you have requested the `verifyCode` of your user, their authentication will be removed from our database.**
