<h1>About Scratchinfo</h1>
<p>Scratchinfo is a project by @god286 on Scratch.</p>
<p>
  This website runs on <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>
  and
  <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> which are both epic tools.
</p>
<p>I was inspired by @Jeffalo who made Ocular and @World_Languages who made ScratchStats.</p>
<p>Information from ScratchDB by DatOneLefty, the official Scratch API, and ocular by Jeffalo.</p>
