<h1>About ScratchInfo</h1>
<p>
  ScratchInfo is a project by @god286 on Scratch. It was made as a test to see
  if I could make a working website.
</p>
<p><b>WE JUST HIT V1.0.0 FOR SCRATCHINFO!</b> Thank you a lot for those who have helped contribute to scratchinfo. You all mean a lot to me.</p>
<p>
  This website runs on <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>
  and
  <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> which are both epic tools.
</p>
<p>I was inspired by @Jeffalo who made Ocular and @World_Languages who made ScratchStats.</p>
<p>Information from ScratchDB by DatOneLefty, the official Scratch API, and Ocular by Jeffalo.</p>
